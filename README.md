## PONG ###
Game done in Processing from my second year of university

- Fully playable game of pong which changes puck direction (not fully random) after each score
- Manually input value for winscore on line 3 for game to end when either side gets to that value

(Improvement Plans):
- Improve randomness of puck after each goal
- Also increment the speed of the puck after each contact with paddles
